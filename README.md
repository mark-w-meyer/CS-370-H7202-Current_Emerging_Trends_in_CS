What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create and innovate solutions for a multitude of problems throughout our everyday lives. They are responsible for being well-versed in a plethora of interdisciplinary studies and technologies that drive the modern world. When you drink your coffee, shop on Amazon, communicate with your friends and family on Facebook, watch YouTube, drive a vehicle (since the invention of the ECM), or do a load of laundry--just to name a few--you can thank a computer scientist. A computer scientist is far greater than just someone who 'writes code'. They take a user's requirements, if even from a simple conversation, and convert that into something you can use in everyday life.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I acquire the user requirements and look at the big picture of the goal to be accomplished. Then, I break down the problem into increasingly smaller problem until I am able to easily discern individual processes and variables. This can be done using pseudocode, flowcharts, UML diagrams, state diagrams, and/or timing diagrams. Once I attain a satisfactory design, I begin to code the application, and as I go along, I adjust my designs if needed. 

I test and comment the code frequently to communicate what I'm trying to accomplish and to assist myself and any others maintaining the application in debugging and/or maintaining the code. During my testing, my goal is to try to break the code in multiple ways and to achieve optimal performance thereby creating a secure and robut software solution to the user requirements. Documentation is made throughout the process to optimize maintenance and sustainability.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization include but are not limited to ensuring the safety of the product, respecting privacy for the end user, designing a product that can be trusted, and ultimately adopting a code of ethics adherent to the latest government regulations in its implementation. It is important that the end user is able to reach an understanding of not only the product performing its objective but that it will do so safely. It is important that the organization be able to trust its engineers to accomplish the integrity of its products.
